Realtime Pipeline API
=====================

The realtime pipeline API provides the reusable host-side runtime for
low-latency QEC pipelines that combine GPU inference with optional CPU
post-processing. The published reference is generated from
``cudaq/qec/realtime/pipeline.h``.

.. note::

   This API is experimental and subject to change.
