//==============================================================================
// Host-side RPC producer for the inproc_rpc realtime decoding path.
//
// These three functions are the host-process counterparts to the three RPC
// handlers wired up by qec_realtime_session + decoder_rpc_dispatch.cu, all
// conformant with proposals/decoder_server_runtime.md:
//   - enqueue_syndromes  GRAPH_LAUNCH; function_id ==
//   fnv1a("enqueue_syndromes")
//                        == kEnqueueSyndromesFunctionId; one captured graph
//                        per decoder; host monitor sub-routes by
//                        (function_id, routing_key=decoder_id).
//   - get_corrections    DEVICE_CALL; function_id == fnv1a("get_corrections")
//                        == kGetCorrectionsFunctionId.
//   - reset_decoder      DEVICE_CALL; function_id == fnv1a("reset_decoder")
//                        == kResetDecoderFunctionId.
//
// All three RPCs are request/response on the wire: the dispatcher always
// emits a 24-byte RPCResponse (status=0, result_len=0 for the two fire-
// and-forget calls; bit-packed correction bytes + 0..7 pad for get_-
// corrections).  Producers wait for the ACK and drop the response body
// for enqueue/reset.
//
// Each function:
//   1. Resolves the per-process session via the `session` argument (no global
//      lookup) so test code can drive a private session without touching
//      `g_realtime_session`.
//   2. Acquires a free RX slot from the ring buffer.
//   3. Writes RPCHeader + the matching wire-format payload from
//      decoder_rpc_ids.h.  Payload scalars are INT64; bools are UINT8+pad;
//      bit-packed arrays are LSB-first; whole payload is padded to an
//      8-byte multiple.
//   4. Publishes the slot by writing the DEVICE-visible RX slot address
//      into rx_flags[slot] (the "address-as-flag" convention of the shared
//      ring; both the HOST_LOOP and DEVICE_LOOP dispatchers expect this).
//   5. Spins on RPCResponse::magic, checks status, and (for
//      get_corrections) reads back the bit-packed result.
//   6. Releases the slot (clears rx_flags + tx_flags + the slot's first
//      bytes so the response magic doesn't get misread on slot reuse).
//
// On any error (no slot within timeout_ms, response timeout, non-zero
// RPC status, malformed result_len), the corresponding function throws
// `std::runtime_error` with a contextual message.  The host-side caller in
// the production path (realtime_decoding.cpp::enqueue_syndromes /
// get_corrections / reset) is also a free function in
// `cudaq::qec::decoding::host`, so it gets to choose how to surface the
// error -- e.g. by logging then rethrowing.
//
// THREAD-SAFETY:
// All three functions are SINGLE-PRODUCER -- this is a hard contract, not
// merely an assumption.  The production caller in realtime_decoding.cpp::
// enqueue_syndromes / get_corrections / reset_decoder is invoked from the QEC
// main loop, which is single-threaded by construction.  The contract is now
// ENFORCED at runtime: each function holds a single_producer_guard that throws
// if a second producer is active concurrently (an always-on check -- a real
// throw, not assert(), so it stays active in release builds).  Full multi-
// producer support (CAS slot-claim or a per-producer arena) remains a
// deliberate follow-up.
//
// acquire_slot() in rpc_producer.cpp scans for a free slot (rx_flags ==
// tx_flags == 0) but does NOT atomically claim it on return.  That's
// fine while there's a single producer (the chosen slot is written
// before the next call to acquire_slot()), but it would race if a
// second producer thread were ever introduced.  Multi-producer support
// is a deliberate follow-up: it requires either (a) a CAS-based atomic
// claim on the rx_flags slot ("0 -> in-progress") inside acquire_slot,
// or (b) a per-producer arena of slots in the ring.  See
// `acquire_slot()` for the inline assumption comment.
//
// As a separate constraint, the *handlers* themselves are not
// re-entrant per-decoder (the plugin's GpuDecoderState is shared
// across in-flight enqueue rounds for that decoder_id), so the
// wire-level contract is "one in-flight RPC per (decoder_id,
// function_id) on the wire at a time" regardless of producer count.
