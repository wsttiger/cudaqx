"""DEM sampling via the C++ pybind11 binding (GPU with cuStabilizer + CPU fallback).

Public API:
    dem_sampling(
        check_matrix, num_shots, error_probabilities, seed=None, backend="auto"
    )

The GPU path uses cuStabilizer for accelerated sampling. The CPU path is
always available as a fallback.

Inputs are NumPy arrays (primary) or PyTorch CUDA tensors (requires
user-installed torch via ``pip install torch``). PyTorch CPU tensors are
not accepted; convert them to NumPy arrays first.

        num_shots: Number of independent Monte-Carlo shots.
        error_probabilities: 1-D array of length num_error_mechanisms with
            independent Bernoulli probabilities for each mechanism.
            Accepts NumPy float64 array or PyTorch CUDA tensor.
        seed: Optional RNG seed for reproducibility.

            - "auto" (default): try GPU, fall back to CPU.
            - "cpu": force CPU implementation.
