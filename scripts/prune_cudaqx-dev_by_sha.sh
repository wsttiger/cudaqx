# NOTE: This script is intended to be run by CUDA-QX maintainers, not regular
# users.

# This script is used to prune the old cudaqx-dev packages from the GitHub
# Packages.  In general, the .github/workflows/build_dev.yaml creates new images
# whenever the CUDA-Q commit is updated, so this script will need to be
# periodically run to keep the number of packages in the GitHub Packages
# manageable.

# The script requires a TOKEN environment variable to be set by the user. The
# token must have read:packages and delete:packages scopes.
