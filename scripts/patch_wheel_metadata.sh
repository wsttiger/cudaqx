# This script is used to patch the wheel metadata for a PyPI package. For now,
# it is anticipated that one would use this script as a reference and update the
# MODIFY_ME1 and MODIFY_ME2 sections before using it.

# Note: you may need to run "python3 -m pip install -U wheel" first.

# MODIFY_ME1 - review and modify the following variables
PACKAGE_NAME_DASH=cudaq-qec
PACKAGE_NAME_UNDER=cudaq_qec
